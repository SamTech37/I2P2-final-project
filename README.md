# 2024 I2P Final Project Group 27 - Tower Defense

## Caveats

After making any changes to the Resource files, you must reload the project  
in VSCode, CMake: Configue

## Features
- a good ol' tower defense game
- Infinite waves
    - all the waves are randomly generated
    - enemies get stronger over time 
- [online scoreboard](https://i2p2-server.vercel.app/)
- in-game upgrade
    - make your turret better
    - plain ol' numeral buffs, nothing fancy
- some new playable stuff

used library: Allegro5, libcurl, nlohmann/json.  
I've also set up a simple json server with Nextjs (should've used express.js instead) and FirebaseDB for the online scoreboard.
